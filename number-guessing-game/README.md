# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (CLI Based)

A simple yet engaging command-line game built using Python where the player guesses a randomly generated number.  
This project demonstrates core programming logic, user input handling, and control flow in a clean and practical way.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Number Guessing Game** challenges the user to guess a number between **1 and 100** that is randomly selected by the computer.

After each guess, the program provides feedback:
- Too high  
- Too low  
- Correct guess  

The game continues until the user successfully guesses the correct number.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many beginners understand Python syntax but struggle to:
- Apply conditional logic meaningfully  
- Use loops effectively  
- Handle invalid user input  

This project solves that by turning basic concepts into a **fully interactive game**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔢 Random number generation  
- 🔁 Unlimited guessing attempts  
- 📊 Guess counter to track performance  
- 🧠 Helpful hints (Too High / Too Low)  
- ❌ Input validation and error handling  
- 🧼 Clean and readable logic  

---

## 🧠 How It Works (High-Level)

1. Computer generates a random number between 1 and 100  
2. User enters a guess  
3. Program compares the guess with the correct number  
4. Feedback is provided after each attempt  
5. Game ends when the correct number is guessed
