# 🧠 Quiz Application (Interactive CLI Quiz Game)

A Python-based command-line quiz game that tests users on Python fundamentals through multiple-choice questions.  
This project showcases clean logic, user interaction, randomness, and state management in a fun, engaging way.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Quiz Application** is an interactive terminal game where users:
- Answer multiple-choice Python questions  
- Receive instant feedback on each answer  
- Get a final score at the end of the quiz  
- Replay the quiz with shuffled questions  

The application is designed to reinforce **core Python knowledge** while demonstrating practical programming concepts.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Learning concepts without testing understanding often leads to shallow knowledge.  
From a developer’s perspective, building quiz systems helps practice:

- Conditional logic  
- Input validation  
- Loop control  
- Data structuring  
- Randomization  

This project solves that by combining **learning + interaction** into a single CLI application.

## ✨ Key Features

- ❓ Multiple-choice questions (MCQs)  
- 🔀 Randomized question order every run  
- 🧠 Instant correctness feedback  
- 📊 Score tracking  
- 🔁 Replay option  
- ❌ Strong input validation  
- 🧼 Clean and readable function-based design  

---

## 🧠 How It Works (High-Level)

1. Questions are stored in a structured list  
2. The list is shuffled randomly  
3. Each question is displayed with four options  
4. User selects an answer (A–D)  
5. Answer is validated and evaluated  
6. Score is updated and displayed  
7. User can replay or exit
