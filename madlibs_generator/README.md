# 📖 Mad Libs Story Generator (CLI Based)

An interactive command-line application that dynamically generates fun stories based on user input.  
This project demonstrates string formatting, regular expressions, and user-driven content creation in Python.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Mad Libs Story Generator** is a Python CLI program where users:
- Provide words such as adjectives, verbs, animals, and places  
- See those words inserted into a pre-defined story template  
- Instantly get a unique and entertaining story every time  

It is a simple yet powerful demonstration of **text processing and dynamic content generation**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many beginner programs only print static output.  
This project focuses on:
- Making programs **interactive**
- Dynamically modifying content at runtime
- Teaching how templates work in real-world applications  

The solution is a **user-driven story generator** that reacts to live input.

## 🧠 How It Works (High-Level)

1. A story template is defined with placeholders  
2. Regular expressions extract required placeholders  
3. The user is prompted to fill each placeholder  
4. Inputs are injected into the story template  
5. A complete, customized story is displayed
