# 🎰 Lucky Match Game (CLI Slot Machine)

A fun and interactive command-line slot machine game built using Python.  
This project simulates a real-world betting game using points, random outcomes, and user-driven gameplay logic.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Lucky Match Game** is a terminal-based game where users:
- Start with free points
- Place bets on multiple lines
- Spin symbols randomly
- Win or lose points based on matching outcomes

The game is inspired by classic **slot machine mechanics** and focuses on clean logic, user interaction, and probability-based outcomes.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Beginner-to-intermediate developers often struggle to:
- Implement game logic cleanly  
- Manage state (points, balance, bets)  
- Handle user input safely  
- Apply randomness in a controlled way  

This project demonstrates how to build a **complete interactive game** using core Python concepts only.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎲 Randomized slot machine symbols  
- 💰 Point-based betting system  
- ➕ Deposit system with validation  
- 🎯 Multi-line betting (1–3 lines)  
- 🧠 Win/Loss calculation logic  
- ❌ Input validation and error handling  
- 🧼 Clean, readable procedural design  

---

## 🧠 How It Works (High-Level)

1. User starts with free points  
2. User selects number of lines to bet on  
3. Points are placed per line  
4. Symbols are randomly generated  
5. Matching symbols result in winnings  
6. Points are updated after each round  
7. Game continues until the user quits

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Modules Used:**  
  - `random` (Symbol generation)
