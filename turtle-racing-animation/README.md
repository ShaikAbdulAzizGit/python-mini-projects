# 🐢 Turtle Racing Animation (Python Turtle Game)

A fun and interactive **turtle racing animation** built using Python’s `turtle` graphics module.  
This project simulates a colorful race where multiple turtle racers compete, showcasing animation, randomness, and user interaction.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Turtle Racing Animation** is a graphical Python game where:
- Users choose the number of turtle racers  
- Each turtle moves forward by a random distance  
- The first turtle to reach the finish line wins  

The project blends **visual animation** with **game logic**, making it a great demonstration of Python’s graphical capabilities.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many Python projects focus only on text-based output.  
This project demonstrates how to:
- Create graphical windows  
- Animate objects on screen  
- Manage multiple entities simultaneously  
- Combine user input with real-time animation  

It turns core programming concepts into a **visually engaging experience**.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🐢 Animated turtle racers  
- 🎨 Multiple colorful turtles  
- 👥 Supports 2–10 racers  
- 🎲 Randomized movement for fair gameplay  
- 🖥️ Graphical window using Turtle graphics  
- 🧼 Clean modular function design  

---

## 🧠 How It Works (High-Level)

1. User selects the number of racers  
2. Turtle graphics window is initialized  
3. Turtles are positioned evenly at the starting line  
4. Each turtle moves forward randomly in a loop  
5. The first turtle to reach the finish line wins  
6. Winner is announced and window closes after a delay
