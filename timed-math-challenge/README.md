# ⏱️ Timed Math Challenge (CLI Speed Math Game)

A Python-based **timed math quiz game** that challenges users to solve arithmetic problems as quickly and accurately as possible.  
This project demonstrates randomness, timing, input validation, and performance tracking in a clean CLI application.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Timed Math Challenge** presents users with a fixed number of math problems involving addition, subtraction, and multiplication.  
The goal is to solve all problems **as fast as possible** while minimizing mistakes.

At the end of the challenge, the program reports:
- Total time taken  
- Number of incorrect attempts  

This makes it both a fun game and a practical exercise in speed and accuracy.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Practicing math often lacks:
- Time pressure  
- Performance feedback  
- Engagement  

From a programming perspective, developers need to learn:
- How to measure execution time  
- How to manage repeated user input  
- How to track performance metrics  

This project solves both by combining **timing + logic + interaction**.

## ✨ Key Features

- ⏱️ Tracks total time taken to complete the quiz  
- 🔢 Randomly generated math problems  
- ➕➖✖️ Multiple operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication)  
- ❌ Mistake counter  
- 🔁 Reattempts until the correct answer is given  
- 🧼 Clean and readable CLI flow  

---

## 🧠 How It Works (High-Level)

1. User presses Enter to start the challenge  
2. Timer starts immediately  
3. Random math expressions are generated  
4. User answers each question  
5. Incorrect answers increase the mistake count  
6. Timer stops after all questions are solved  
7. Final performance summary is displayed
