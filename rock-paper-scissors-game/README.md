# ✊✋✌️ Rock Paper Scissors Game (CLI Based)

A classic **Rock–Paper–Scissors** game implemented using Python and played directly in the command line.  
This project focuses on clean logic, user interaction, and control flow while turning a simple idea into a complete, replayable game.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Rock Paper Scissors Game** allows a user to play against the computer by choosing:
- Rock (`r`)
- Paper (`p`)
- Scissors (`s`)

The computer randomly selects its move, and the game determines the winner based on standard game rules.

This project is a great demonstration of **decision-making logic and interactive CLI design**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

While learning programming fundamentals, developers often struggle to:
- Convert logical rules into code  
- Handle repeated user interaction  
- Validate inputs correctly  

This project solves those challenges by implementing a **well-structured, rule-based game loop**.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎮 Classic Rock–Paper–Scissors gameplay  
- 🤖 Computer opponent with random choices  
- 🔁 Replay option without restarting the program  
- 🧠 Clear win/lose/draw logic  
- ❌ Input validation for user choices  
- 🧼 Clean and readable function-based design  

---

## 🧠 How It Works (High-Level)

1. User selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors  
2. Computer randomly selects its move  
3. Both choices are displayed clearly  
4. Game rules determine the winner  
5. User can choose to play again or exit
