# 🎲 Roll and Risk Game (Multiplayer CLI Dice Game)

A fun, turn-based **multiplayer dice game** built using Python where players balance risk and reward to reach the winning score.  
This project demonstrates game loops, player state management, randomness, and clean user interaction in a CLI environment.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Roll and Risk Game** is a command-line dice game for **2 to 4 players**.  
Each player takes turns rolling a dice to accumulate points. Rolling higher numbers increases the score, but rolling a **1** resets the player’s score to zero—adding a strategic risk element.

The first player to reach **50 points** wins the game.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many beginner projects focus only on single-user logic.  
This project goes a step further by implementing:

- Turn-based multiplayer logic  
- Shared and individual game state  
- Risk–reward decision making  
- Continuous game loops with exit conditions  

It demonstrates how to design **interactive, stateful games** using core Python only.

## ✨ Key Features

- 👥 Supports 2–4 players  
- 🎲 Random dice rolling  
- 🔁 Turn-based gameplay  
- ⚠️ Risk mechanic (rolling 1 resets score)  
- 🏆 Automatic winner detection  
- ❌ Input validation and error handling  
- 🧼 Clean, readable procedural design  

---

## 🧠 How It Works (High-Level)

1. Players choose how many participants will play  
2. Each player takes turns rolling the dice  
3. Players can choose to roll again or stop  
4. Rolling a 1 resets the player’s score  
5. Scores are tracked across turns  
6. First player to reach 50 points wins
