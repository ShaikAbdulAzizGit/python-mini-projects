# ✅ To-Do List Application (CLI Task Manager)

A simple and effective **command-line To-Do List application** built using Python.  
This project demonstrates CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), user input handling, and clean control flow using modern Python syntax.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **To-Do List Application** helps users manage daily tasks directly from the terminal.  
Users can add new tasks, view existing tasks, update tasks, and delete completed or unwanted tasks.

This project focuses on **practical utility**, making it a great example of how core Python concepts translate into real-world tools.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Managing tasks doesn’t always require complex apps.  
From a learning perspective, developers need hands-on practice with:

- Data manipulation (lists)  
- User-driven workflows  
- Menu-based program design  
- CRUD operations  

This project solves that by implementing a **clean, interactive task manager** using only core Python.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ➕ Add new tasks  
- 👀 View all tasks  
- ✏️ Update existing tasks  
- 🗑️ Delete tasks  
- 📋 Menu-driven interface  
- ❌ Graceful handling of empty task lists  
- 🧼 Clean and readable function-based design  

---

## 🧠 How It Works (High-Level)

1. Main menu displays available actions  
2. User selects an option (Add / View / Update / Delete)  
3. Tasks are stored in a list during runtime  
4. Selected operation is performed on the task list  
5. Updated task list is displayed immediately
