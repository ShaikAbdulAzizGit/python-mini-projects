# 🧮 Simple Calculator (CLI Based)

A lightweight **command-line calculator** built using Python that performs basic arithmetic operations.  
This project demonstrates clean input handling, control flow using `match-case`, and interactive CLI program design.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Simple Calculator** allows users to:
- Enter two numbers  
- Choose an arithmetic operation  
- Instantly see the result  
- Continue calculations without restarting the program  

It is a practical beginner-friendly project that reflects **real-world utility and strong Python fundamentals**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many beginner scripts perform only a single calculation and exit.  
This project improves on that by focusing on:

- Continuous user interaction  
- Clear operation selection  
- Error handling for invalid input  
- Clean control flow using modern Python syntax  

The result is a **reusable and interactive calculator tool**.

## ✨ Key Features

- ➕ Addition  
- ➖ Subtraction  
- ✖️ Multiplication  
- ➗ Division  
- 🔁 Continuous calculations  
- ❌ Error handling with `try-except`  
- 🧼 Clean and readable `match-case` logic  

---

## 🧠 How It Works (High-Level)

1. User enters two numbers  
2. User selects an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)  
3. Program matches the operation and performs calculation  
4. Result is displayed instantly  
5. User decides whether to continue or exit
